# Channel Estimation using LS and MMSE for MIMO-OFDM Systems

## üìñ Overview
This repository provides a study and simulation of **Least Squares (LS)** and **Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE)** channel estimation techniques applied to **MIMO-OFDM systems**.  
The research investigates pilot-assisted block-type training for estimating channel state information (CSI), focusing on the trade-off between **bit error rate (BER)**, **signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)**, and computational complexity.  

The work is based on the IEEE paper:  
**"Channel Estimation using LS and MMSE Channel Estimation Techniques for MIMO-OFDM Systems" (2022).**

## ‚ú® Key Contributions
- Implementation of **pilot-aided channel estimation** for OFDM.
- Comparative study of **LS vs. MMSE estimators**.
- Analysis of **BER vs. SNR** under different modulation schemes (BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, 32-QAM, 64-QAM).
- Evaluation of **mean square error (MSE)** and **symbol error rate (SER)** performance.
- Application scenarios for **MIMO wireless systems, LTE/LTE-A, and 6G candidates**.

## üîç Observations
- **LS Estimator**: Simple, lower computational load, but higher MSE.  
- **MMSE Estimator**: Better accuracy, reduced BER and SER, but computationally more complex.  
- **Higher-order QAM schemes**: Increase data rates but introduce greater sensitivity to noise and fading.  
- **Pilot design** is critical for achieving reliable estimation.

## üöÄ Future Work
- Integration of **adaptive algorithms (LMS, RLS, Kalman filters)**.  
- Use of **compressive sensing** for sparse channel estimation.  
- Application of **deep learning-based channel estimators** for massive MIMO and mmWave systems.  
- Multi-band evaluation for **5G/6G heterogeneous networks**.
